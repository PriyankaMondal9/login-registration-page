You need to create a website that will have one simple login functionality, one simple registration functionality, a log out functionality, and a simple dashboard.
The dashboard needs to show a text Hello <username> and a Logout button, that's it. It will be your landing page.
User can only enter in the dashboard if he is logged in, otherwise, he will be automatically redirected to the login page.
On the login page, there will be a form for login and a registration link.
On the registration page, there will be a simple form for registration and a link for the login page.
Once the user is logged in or registered, he needs to redirect to the dashboard (landing) page.
This is the code information
